# Testing Guide: Comments & Suggestions System

This guide walks you through testing all features of the comments and suggestions system.

## Test Document

We've created `test-workflow.md` with pre-populated comments and suggestions for testing.

## What's Already Been Set Up (via CLI)

The following was added programmatically to demonstrate batch operations:

### 1. Batch Comments Added
```bash
./comments batch-add examples/test-workflow.md --json initial-comments.json
```
- 4 comments added by different users (reviewer, editor, tech-lead, designer)
- Comment types: Q (Question), S (Suggestion), T (TODO), E (Enhancement)

### 2. Batch Suggestions Added
```bash
./comments batch-add examples/test-workflow.md --json suggestions.json
```
- 3 edit suggestions created:
  - Line 5: Simplify intro (line replacement)
  - Lines 8-11: Improve list formatting (multi-line replacement)
  - Line 29: Add specific example (line replacement)

### 3. Single Command Examples
```bash
# Single reply
./comments reply examples/test-workflow.md --thread <id> --author "author" --text "Response"

# Single comment
./comments add examples/test-workflow.md --line 45 --author "qa-engineer" --text "Add test coverage" --type "T"
```

### 4. Batch Replies
```bash
./comments batch-reply examples/test-workflow.md --json replies.json

## Verification Checklist

After testing, verify:

- [ ] All TUI modes work (Browse, LineSelect, AddComment, AddSuggestion, ThreadView, Reply, Resolve, ReviewSuggestion)
- [ ] Comments and suggestions visually distinguished
- [ ] Acceptance states clear (pending/accepted/rejected)
- [ ] Document updates correctly when suggestions accepted
- [ ] Position tracking works (comments stay on correct lines)
- [ ] Sidecar JSON file is valid (`cat examples/test-workflow.md.comments.json | python -m json.tool`)
- [ ] No crashes or errors during normal usage
- [ ] Help text is accurate and helpful

---

## Expected File State

After all testing:
- `examples/test-workflow.md` - Modified markdown content (if suggestions accepted)
- `examples/test-workflow.md.comments.json` - Contains ~10-15 comments/suggestions with various states

---

## Tips

- The TUI uses Vim-style keybindings (`j/k` for navigation)
- All modals can be cancelled with `Esc`
- `Ctrl+S` submits in input modes
- Suggestions show metadata in thread view
- Press `R` (capital R) to toggle resolved comments
- Line numbers in document match comment positions

---

## Troubleshooting

**Document doesn't load:**
- Check file path is correct
- Ensure sidecar JSON is valid

**Suggestions don't show indicators:**
- Check comment has `SuggestionType` field in JSON
- Verify `AcceptanceState` is set

**Accept fails:**
- Original text may have changed (validation error)
- Check error message for details

## Success Criteria

‚úÖ All 10 test cases pass
‚úÖ No crashes or hangs
‚úÖ Data persists correctly
‚úÖ UI is responsive and clear
‚úÖ Help text guides users effectively

Happy testing! üéâ
