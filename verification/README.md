# Verification Strategy

## Overview

This directory contains comprehensive, technology-agnostic verification specifications for the CLI-based collaborative document commenting system with LLM integration.

**Purpose**: Define what to verify and how to verify it, independent of testing frameworks or implementation languages.

## Philosophy

Our verification approach focuses on:

1. **Observable Behaviors**: Test what the system does, not how it does it
2. **Contracts**: Define clear input/output agreements at component boundaries
3. **Data Flows**: Verify data transformations are correct and lossless
4. **Quality Attributes**: Ensure performance, reliability, and usability requirements

4. Measure end-to-end performance
5. Validate invariants at all checkpoints

## Verification Matrix

**Location**: `/VERIFICATION_MATRIX.md` (project root)

**Purpose**: Map verification specs to components, requirements, and test cases

### What's in the Matrix

- Component coverage table
- User scenario mapping
- Quality attribute verification
- Data flow coverage
- Edge case documentation
- Integration point verification
- Traceability (requirements → specs → tests)

### How to Use

1. **For Planning**: Identify coverage gaps
2. **For Development**: Find relevant specs for your component
3. **For Testing**: Map specs to test cases
4. **For Verification**: Check completion status

## Testing Strategy

### Recommended Test Layers

1. **Unit Tests** (per component)
   - Based on contract specifications
   - Fast, isolated, deterministic
   - Target: 80%+ code coverage

2. **Integration Tests** (component pairs)
   - Based on data flow specifications
   - Verify component interactions
   - Target: All critical integration points

3. **Behavioral Tests** (user scenarios)
   - Based on behavioral specifications
   - End-to-end user journeys
   - Target: All critical user paths

4. **Performance Tests**
   - Based on performance criteria in all specs
   - Measure actual vs. target metrics
   - Target: All performance requirements met

### Test Automation

These specifications are **framework-agnostic**. You can implement them with:

- **JavaScript/TypeScript**: Jest, Mocha, Vitest
- **Python**: pytest, unittest
- **Rust**: built-in test framework
- **Go**: testing package
- **Any language**: Cucumber/Gherkin for behavioral tests

### Implementation Approach

**Test-Driven Development (TDD)**:

1. Choose a behavioral scenario or contract
2. Write failing tests based on the spec
3. Implement minimum code to pass tests
4. Refactor while keeping tests green
5. Verify all acceptance criteria met

**Behavior-Driven Development (BDD)**:

1. Start with Given-When-Then scenarios
2. Implement step definitions
3. Run scenarios as executable specifications
4. Iterate until all scenarios pass

## Quality Criteria

## Examples

### Example: Implementing Comment Creation

1. **Read Behavioral Spec** (`02-comment-creation.yaml`):
   ```yaml
   - name: "Add comment at cursor position"
     given:
       - "Cursor positioned at line 42, column 10"
     when:
       - "User creates comment"
     then:
       - "Comment object created with metadata"
       - "Comment inserted at position"
   ```

2. **Read Contract** (`parser-contract.yaml`):
   ```yaml
   CreateComment:
     input:
       document_id: uuid
       text: string
       position: Position
     output:
       success:
         comment_id: string
         serialized: string
   ```

3. **Write Test** (pseudo-code):
   ```javascript
   test('add comment at cursor position', () => {
     // Given
     const doc = openDocument('test.md');
     moveCursor(doc, {line: 42, column: 10});

     // When
     const result = createComment(doc, 'My comment');

     // Then
     expect(result.comment_id).toBeDefined();
     expect(result.position.line).toBe(42);
     expect(doc.content).toContain('{>>[@');
   });
   ```

4. **Implement** until test passes

5. **Verify** all acceptance criteria from spec

## Maintenance

### When to Update Specs

- **Requirements change**: Update behavioral specs first
- **Architecture changes**: Update contracts and flows
- **New features**: Create new behavioral scenarios
- **Performance issues**: Revise performance criteria
- **Bugs found**: Add edge case scenarios

### Review Process

1. **Before Implementation**: Review specs for completeness
2. **During Development**: Reference specs continuously
3. **Before Release**: Verify all specs have passing tests
4. **After Release**: Update specs based on learnings

## FAQ

**Q: Why YAML instead of code?**
A: YAML is language-agnostic, human-readable, and separates "what to verify" from "how to verify."

**Q: Do I need to implement every scenario?**
A: Prioritize critical path and high-priority scenarios first. The specs show what's critical vs. nice-to-have.

**Q: Can I add more scenarios?**
A: Absolutely! These specs are living documents. Add scenarios as you discover edge cases.

**Q: What if a scenario is unclear?**
A: Refer to the architecture docs (`/docs/`), ask questions, and clarify the spec.

**Q: How do I know when I'm done?**
A: Check the verification matrix and ensure all critical scenarios have passing tests and performance targets are met.
